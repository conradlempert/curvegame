This is a multiplayer game about surviving the longest as a snake.

## Run the server

Run this in the root folder of the repository:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

## Play the game

This is a multiplayer game (i.e., you want to join the server from multiple clients).

If you are playing on the computer that is running the server, go to `http://localhost:3000`.

If you want to join from another computer on the local network, first find out the local IP address of the server ([tutorial](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address/)), which looks something like e.g. `192.168.1.60`. Then you would join the server from another computer by opening e.g. `http://192.168.1.60:3000`.

## Deploy = TODO

I'm currently working on deploying the game so it can also be played online.
